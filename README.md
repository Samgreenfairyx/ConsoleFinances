Console Finances
Overview
This project, titled "Console Finances," showcases my JavaScript skills in analyzing financial records. The task involved processing a dataset with arrays containing dates and corresponding profits/losses. The primary goal was to implement JavaScript code to calculate key financial metrics and display the results in the console.
